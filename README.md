# week-1-assignment-fixed

New repo for my week 1 assignment after the previous one was broken because of large audio file issue

Reflection
My biggest problem was with the audio file that I tried to use. I couldn't get the HTML audio tag working so I gave up on that and deleted the file from this folder (using delete in VS Code, not a git rm in the console, which might've been what caused the problem), but it still showed up saying that it was too large so couldn't be committed to github properly. The file was 109 MB when the github limit is 100 MB so I tried an Indiana Jones-esque solution of swapping it for a much smaller audio file that I renamed to have the same name. As I'm typing this I'm about to commit again to see if that works.

It didn't work.

Now I'm trying to fix the problem with a stack overflow thread that I've found (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19573031/cant-push-to-github-because-of-large-file-which-i-already-deleted). This didn't work for me either, possibly because I'm not confident enough with github or the terminal to know which of the proposed solutions would've been right for me. Instead I've made a new github repo and copied the files across.
