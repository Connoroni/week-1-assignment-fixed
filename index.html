          There are two species of gorilla: the Eastern gorilla (Gorilla
          beringei) and the Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). Eastern gorillas
          are found in some places, and Western gorillas are found in others.
          Within each of these two species there are two subspecies. The
          subspecies of the Eastern gorilla are the Eastern lowland gorilla and
          Mountain gorilla. The subspecies of the Western gorilla are the Cross
          River gorilla and Western Lowland gorilla.

            <p>
              The Eastern Lowland gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) is a
              Critically Endangered subspecies of eastern gorilla endemic to the
              mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
              Important populations of this gorilla live in the Kahuzi-Biega and
              Maiko National Parks and their adjacent forests, the Tayna Gorilla
              Reserve, the Usala forest and on the Itombwe Massif.
              <br /><br />
              It is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. It has a jet
              black coat like the mountain gorilla , although the hair is
              shorter on the head and body. The male's coat, like that of other
              gorillas, greys as the animal matures, resulting in the
              designation "silverback".
              <br /><br />
              There are far fewer eastern lowland gorillas compared to western
              lowland gorillas. According to a 2004 report there were only about
              5,000 eastern lowland gorillas in the wild, down to fewer than
              3,800 in 2016, compared to over 100,000 western lowland gorillas.
              However, a survey in 2021 gave an estimate of up to 6,800
              suggesting the decline was not as bad as feared although they are
              still facing severe threats.
              <br /><br />
              Eastern lowland gorillas are the largest subspecies of gorilla and
              the largest living primates. Males weigh between 150 and 209
              kilograms (331 and 461 lb) based on four males, females of 76
              kilograms (168 lb) although this had a small sample size. Males
              stand between 1.69 to 1.96 metres (5 ft 7 in to 6 ft 5 in), while
              females reach 1.6 metres (5.2 ft).
              <br /><br />
              Eastern lowland gorillas are highly sociable and very peaceful,
              living in groups of two to over 30. A group usually consists of
              one silverback, several females and their offspring. Silverbacks
              are strong and each group has one dominant leader. These males
              protect their group from danger. Young silverback males will
              slowly begin to leave their natal group when they reach maturity,
              and will then attempt to attract females to form their own group.
              <br /><br />
              Civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in a
              decline in eastern lowland gorillas. The region inhabited by
              eastern gorillas has decreased from 21,000 to 12,000 km&#178; in the
              past 50 years. This primate species now occupies only 13% of its
              historical area. Violence in the region has made research
              difficult, however, scientists have estimated that the population
              has decreased by more than 50% since the mid-1990s. In the
              mid-1990s, the population was recorded to be nearly 17,000
              gorillas.
              <br /><br />
              The civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo means
              military groups remain in the forest for long periods of time.
              Thus, poaching has increased as militia and refugees become
              hungry. Military leaders have also disarmed the park security
              guards in national parks meaning they have virtually no control
              over the activities that occur within the park, and those that
              enter it, when faced with armed soldiers. The militia groups
              present in the region restrict protection of the eastern lowland
              gorilla. It has been estimated that more than half of the 240
              gorillas known in one study have been killed as a result of
              poaching. Researchers have also stated that it is more difficult
              to patrol areas outside of the park and expect to find even higher
              levels of poaching.
              <br /><br />
              Conservation groups negotiated with rebels who control the eastern
              Democratic Republic of the Congo to re-arm the park guards After
              the war began, government funding of the park was stopped.
              Conservation groups, International Gorilla Conservation Program
              and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German
              development agency) have funded the guards for the past several
              years.

            <p>
              The Mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) is an Endangered
              subspecies of gorilla. There are two populations: One is found in
              the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central/East Africa, within
              three National Parks: Mgahinga, in southwest Uganda; Volcanoes, in
              northwest Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic
              of Congo (DRC). The other population is found in Uganda's Bwindi
              Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists speculate the
              Bwindi population is a separate subspecies.
              <br /><br />
              The fur of the mountain gorilla, often thicker and longer than
              that of other gorilla species, enables them to live in colder
              temperatures. Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to
              each individual Males reach a standing height of 161–171 cm (63–67
              in), a girth of 138–163 cm (54–64 in), an arm span of 2 to 2.7 m
              (6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 10 in) and a weight of 120–191 kg (265–421 lb).
              Females are smaller with a weight of 70–98 kg (154–216 lb).[10]
              This subspecies is smaller than the eastern lowland gorilla, the
              other subspecies of eastern gorilla. Adult males have more
              pronounced bony crests on the top and back of their skulls, giving
              their heads a more conical shape. These crests anchor the powerful
              temporalis muscles, which attach to the lower jaw (mandible).
              Adult females also have these crests, but they are less
              pronounced.
              <br /><br />
              The mountain gorilla is highly social, and lives in relatively
              stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between
              adult males and females. Relationships among females are
              relatively weak.These groups are nonterritorial; the silverback
              generally defends his group rather than his territory. In the
              Virunga mountain gorillas, the average length of tenure for a
              dominant silverback is 4.7 years.
              <br /><br />
              61% of groups are composed of one adult male and a number of
              females and 36% contain more than one adult male. The remaining
              gorillas are either lone males or exclusively male groups, usually
              made up of one mature male and a few younger males. Group sizes
              vary from five to thirty, with an average of ten individuals. A
              typical group contains: one dominant silverback, who is the
              group's undisputed leader; another subordinate silverback (usually
              a younger brother, half-brother, or even an adult son of the
              dominant silverback); one or two blackbacks, who act as sentries;
              three to four sexually mature females, who have bonded for life to
              the dominant silverback; and from three to six juveniles and
              infants.
              <br /><br />
              Although strong and powerful, mountain gorillas are generally
              gentle and very shy. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups,
              but when two mountain gorilla groups meet, sometimes the two
              silverbacks can engage in a fight to the death, using their
              canines to cause deep, gaping injuries. Conflicts are most often
              resolved by displays and other threat behaviors that are intended
              to intimidate without becoming physical. A ritualized charge
              display is unique to gorillas. The entire sequence has nine steps:
              (1) progressively quickening hooting, (2) symbolic feeding, (3)
              rising bipedally, (4) throwing vegetation, (5) chest-beating with
              cupped hands, (6) one leg kick, (7) sideways running four-legged,
              (8) slapping and tearing vegetation, and (9) thumping the ground
              with palms. Jill Donisthorpe has stated that a male charged at her
              twice. In both cases, the gorilla turned away when she stood her
              ground.
              <br /><br />
              The midday rest period is an important time for establishing and
              reinforcing relationships within the group. Mutual grooming
              reinforces social bonds, and helps keep hair free from dirt and
              parasites. It is not so common among gorillas as in other
              primates, although females groom their offspring regularly.
              <br /><br />
              Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large
              adults. Playing helps them learn how to communicate and behave
              within the group. Activities include wrestling, chasing, and
              somersaults. The silverback and his females tolerate and, if
              encouraged, even participate.

            <p>
              The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is a Critically
              Endangered subspecies of western gorilla. It is the most western
              and northern form of gorilla, and is restricted to the forested
              hills and mountains of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region at the
              headwaters of the Cross River. It is separated by about 300 km
              from the nearest population of western lowland gorillas, and by
              around 250 km from the gorilla population in the Ebo Forest of
              Cameroon. Estimates from 2014 suggest that fewer than 250 mature
              Cross River gorillas remain, making them the world's rarest great
              ape. Groups of these gorillas concentrate their activities in 11
              localities across a 12,000 km&#178 range, though recent field surveys
              confirmed the presence of gorillas outside of their known
              localities suggesting a wider distribution within this range.
              <br /><br />
              When comparing the Cross River gorilla to western lowland
              gorillas, they have noticeably smaller palates, smaller cranial
              vaults, and shorter skulls. The Cross River gorilla is not known
              to differ much in terms of body size or limb and bone length from
              western lowland gorillas. However, measurements taken from a male
              suggest that they have shorter hands and feet and have a larger
              opposability index than western lowland gorillas.
              <br /><br />
              The habitats of the Cross River gorilla are negatively affected by
              the drastic deforestation and fragmentation of the land. These
              unfortunate events leave the gorilla species with few options for
              survival. As a result of deforestation and fragmentation, there
              are drastic reductions in carrying capacity, in other words, the
              size of the territories these animals inhabit has been
              significantly reduced. Because the population of humans living in
              this area is high, the amount of resources available to the Cross
              River gorillas is limited. Even though this decrease in the
              availability of land may appear to be a problem, research studies
              have found that an adequate amount of rainforest still remains
              that is suitable and comfortable for this subspecies. If, however,
              human pressures and activities towards deforestation continue,
              these territories will continue to diminish and ultimately will
              not exist. Additional examples of human activity that threaten
              Cross River gorillas and, of course, other species, are hunting,
              logging, agriculture, fuel wood harvesting, clearance of lands for
              plantation and exploitation of natural resources. Gorillas and
              other primates are only a small part of the larger ecosystem and
              thus, they rely on many aspects of their habitat for survival.
              Furthermore, also because of their body size, they lack ability to
              adapt to new environment and they have a rather slow reproductive
              rate. Even though there is somewhat of a limited research on Cross
              River gorillas, there is enough to conclude that these animals are
              currently able to sustain survival. What is still under debate is
              the total number of Cross River gorillas that exist.
              <br /><br />
              The groups of Cross River gorillas consist mainly of one male and
              six to seven females plus their offspring. Gorillas in lowlands
              are seen to have fewer offspring than those in the highlands. This
              is thought to be because of the hunting rate in the lowlands and
              infant mortality rate. The groups in the highlands are densely
              populated compared to those in the lowlands.
              <br /><br />
              The Cross River gorilla's diet consists largely of fruit,
              herbaceous vegetation, liana, and tree bark. Much like their
              nesting habits, what they eat is contingent on the season.
              Observations of the gorilla indicate that it seems to prefer
              fruit, but will settle for other sources of nutrition during the
              dry season of about 4–5 months in northern regions. Cross River
              gorillas eat more liana and tree bark throughout the year, and
              less fruit during dry periods of scarcity.

            <p>
              The Western Lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) is one of
              two Critically Endangered subspecies of the western gorilla. that
              lives in montane, primary and secondary forest and lowland
              swampland in central Africa in Angola , Cameroon, Central African
              Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
              Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is the nominate subspecies of the
              western gorilla, and the smallest of the four gorilla subspecies.
              <br /><br />
              The western lowland gorilla is the only subspecies kept in zoos
              with the exception of Amahoro, a female eastern lowland gorilla at
              Antwerp Zoo, and a few mountain gorillas kept captive in the
              Democratic Republic of the Congo.
              <br /><br />
              This species of gorillas exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism.
              They possess no tails and have jet black skin along with coarse
              black hair that covers their entire body except for the face,
              ears, hands and feet. The hair on the back and rump of males takes
              on a grey coloration and is also lost as they get older. This
              coloration is the reason why older males are known as
              "silverbacks". Their hands are proportionately large with nails on
              all digits (similar to those of humans) and very large thumbs.
              They have short muzzles, prominent brow ridges, large nostrils and
              small eyes and ears. Other features are large muscles in the jaw
              region along with broad and strong teeth. Among these teeth are
              strong sets of frontal canines and large molars in the back of the
              mouth for grinding fruits and vegetables.

              A male standing erect can be up to 1.83 m (6 ft 0 in) tall and
              weigh up to 227 kg (500 lb). Males have an average weight of 140
              kg (310 lb), females of 90 kg (200 lb). Males in captivity,
              however, are noted to be capable of reaching weights up to 275 kg
              (606 lb). Males stand upright at 1.67 m (5 ft 6 in), females at
              1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). Zoo owner John Aspinall claimed a silverback
              gorilla in his prime has the physical strength of seven or eight
              Olympic weightlifters, but this claim is unverified. Western
              gorillas frequently stand upright, but walk in a hunched,
              quadrupedal fashion, with hands curled and knuckles touching the
              ground; as a result, their arm span is greater than their standing
              height.
              <br /><br />
              Western lowland gorilla groups travel within a home range
              typically between 8 and 45 km^2 in area. Gorillas do not display
              territorial behavior, and neighboring groups often overlap ranges.
              The group usually favours a certain area within the home range,
              but seems to follow a seasonal pattern depending upon the
              availability of ripening fruits and, at some sites, localised
              large open clearings (swamps and "bais"). Gorillas normally travel
              3–5 km (1.9–3.1 mi) per day. Populations feeding on high-energy
              foods that vary spatially and seasonally tend to have greater day
              ranges than those feeding on lower-quality but more consistently
              available foods. Larger groups travel greater distances in order
              to obtain sufficient food.
              <br /><br />
              It is easier for males to travel alone and move between groups, as
              before reaching the age of sexual maturity, males leave their
              natal group and go through a “bachelor stage” that can last
              several years either in solitary or in a nonbreeding group.
              However, while both sexes leave their birth group, females are
              always part of a breeding group. Males like to settle with other
              male members of their family. Their breeding groups consist of one
              silverback male, three adult females and their offspring. The male
              gorilla has the role of the protector. Females tend to make bonds
              with other females in their natal group only, but form strong
              bonds with males. Males also aggressively compete for contact with
              females.
              <br /><br />
              The group of gorillas is led by one or more adult males. In cases
              where there is more than one silverback male in a group, they are
              most likely father and son. Groups containing only one male are
              believed to be the basic unit of the social group, gradually
              growing in size due to reproduction and new members migrating in.
              In the study done at Lope, gorillas harvest most of their food
              arboreally, but less than half of their night nests are built in
              trees. They are often found on the ground, and the group has up to
              30 gorillas. Western lowland gorillas live in the smallest family
              groups of all gorillas, with an average of four to eight members
              in each. The leader (the silverback) organizes group activities,
              like eating, nesting and travelling in their home range. Those who
              challenge this alpha male are apt to be cowed by impressive shows
              of physical power. He may stand upright, throw things, make
              aggressive charges, and pound his huge chest with open or cupped
              hands while barking out powerful hoots or unleashing a frightening
              roar. Despite these displays and the animals' obvious physical
              power, gorillas are generally calm and nonaggressive unless they
              are disturbed. Young gorillas, from three to six years old, remind
              human observers of children. Much of their day is spent in play,
              climbing trees, chasing one another and swinging from branches.
              <br /><br />
              Their intelligence is displayed through their ability to fashion
              natural materials into tools that help them gather food more
              conveniently. While the use and manufacture of tools to extract
              ants and termites is a well-documented behavior in wild
              chimpanzees, it has never been observed in other great apes in
              their natural habitat and never seen in other primates in
              captivity.
              <br /><br />
              Western lowland gorillas can adapt tools to a particular use by
              selecting branches, removing projections such as leaves and bark,
              and adapting their length to the depth of the holes. It appears
              that they also plan the use of the tool, since they begin with one
              of the biggest sticks available and progressively modify it until
              it is the perfect fit for inserting into a hole that contains
              food. This demonstrates the gorillas' acquisition of high level
              sensorimotor intelligence, similar to that of young human
              children.
              <br /><br />
              A gorilla has been observed to use a stick to measure the depth of
              water. In 2009, a western lowland gorilla at Buffalo Zoological
              Gardens used a bucket to collect water. In an experiment, one
              adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas were given
              five-gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger
              females were able to fill the buckets with water. This is the
              first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in
              zoos.

        <p class="section-p">
          All species (and subspecies) of gorilla are listed as endangered or
          critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. All gorillas are listed in
          Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
          Species (CITES), meaning that international export/import of the
          species, including in parts and derivatives, is regulated. Around
          316,000 western lowland gorillas are thought to exist in the wild,
          4,000 in zoos, thanks to conservation; eastern lowland gorillas have a
          population of under 5,000 in the wild and 24 in zoos. Mountain
          gorillas are the most severely endangered, with an estimated
          population of about 880 left in the wild and none in zoos. Threats to
          gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the
          bushmeat trade. Gorillas are closely related to humans, and are
          susceptible to diseases that humans also get infected by. In 2004, a
          population of several hundred gorillas in the Odzala National Park,
          Republic of Congo was essentially wiped out by the Ebola virus. A 2006
          study published in Science concluded more than 5,000 gorillas may have
          died in recent outbreaks of the Ebola virus in central Africa. The
          researchers indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these
          apes, the virus creates "a recipe for rapid ecological extinction". In
          captivity, it has also been observed that gorillas can also be
          infected with COVID-19.
          <br /><br />
          Conservation efforts include the Great Apes Survival Project, a
          partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme and the
          UNESCO, and also an international treaty, the Agreement on the
          Conservation of Gorillas and Their Habitats, concluded under
          UNEP-administered Convention on Migratory Species. The Gorilla
          Agreement is the first legally binding instrument exclusively
          targeting gorilla conservation; it came into effect on 1 June 2008.
          Governments of countries where gorillas live placed a ban on their
          killing and trading, but weak law enforcement still poses a threat to
          them, since the governments rarely apprehend poachers, traders and
          consumers that rely on gorillas for profit.
          <br /><br />
          Individuals can contribute significantly to gorilla conservation by
          supporting organizations dedicated to protecting these great apes and
          their habitats, such as the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and the World
          Wildlife Fund (WWF). These organizations work on initiatives like the
          Great Apes Survival Project and the Gorilla Agreement, which aim to
          safeguard gorilla populations and preserve their ecosystems. Reducing
          habitat destruction is another crucial step; consumers can prioritize
          sustainably sourced products, such as those free from non-sustainable
          palm oil, and recycle electronics to reduce the demand for coltan, a
          mineral often mined in gorilla habitats.
          <br /><br />
          Raising awareness is essential to galvanize broader conservation
          efforts. By educating others about the threats facing gorillas and
          sharing information through social media or community programs,
          individuals can help build widespread support for protective measures.
          Responsible tourism also plays a role in conservation. Visitors to
          gorilla habitats should choose eco-friendly tourism operators that
          prioritize wildlife protection and follow strict guidelines to
          minimize human impact on gorilla populations, including maintaining
          safe distances and adhering to health protocols to prevent disease
          transmission.
          <br /><br />
          Supporting stronger enforcement of anti-poaching laws and advocating
          for increased funding for national parks and protected reserves are
          critical for addressing the threats of illegal hunting and weak law
          enforcement. Combatting diseases such as Ebola and COVID-19 that have
          devastated gorilla populations involves supporting research
          initiatives and vaccination programs, as well as promoting health
          practices to reduce the risk of cross-species disease transmission in
          areas where humans and gorillas interact.
          <br /><br />
          Empowering local communities near gorilla habitats is another vital
          strategy. Programs providing alternative livelihoods, such as
          sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, can reduce dependence on
          activities harmful to gorillas. Initiatives that improve education,
          healthcare, and economic opportunities in these regions foster
          long-term community investment in conservation. Through these combined
          efforts, individuals can play a meaningful role in ensuring the
          survival of gorillas and the protection of their natural habitats.

          OUR LATEST STORY: Gorilla Hosts Viral "Art Show" After Stealing
          Zookeeper's Paint Supplies
        </h2>
        <p class="section-p">
          <br />
          In an unexpected display of artistic talent, a 350-pound silverback
          gorilla named Harambe Jr., residing at the Rockview Zoo, has taken the
          internet by storm with his impromptu &quot;art exhibit.&quot; The
          primate pilfered paint supplies from a distracted zookeeper and spent
          hours creating colorful abstract designs on the walls of his
          enclosure. Zoo staff discovered the masterpiece early Thursday
          morning, and it&apos;s since been dubbed &quot;The Gorilla
          Gallery&quot; by visitors.<br />
          <br />
          &quot;It&apos;s incredible,&quot; said Amanda Green, a senior
          zookeeper. &quot;We didn&apos;t know Harambe Jr. had an artistic
          streak. He&apos;s typically more interested in bananas than
          brushes.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          The artistic escapade began when zookeeper Kyle Henderson left a
          bucket of non-toxic paints and brushes unattended during an enclosure
          renovation. Surveillance footage shows Harambe Jr. cautiously
          approaching the supplies, then using his fingers, palms, and even his
          feet to create vibrant splashes of color across the enclosure&apos;s
          walls. The gorilla incorporated hay and bits of bark into his work,
          giving it a distinct &quot;jungle vibe.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          The exhibit has drawn record-breaking crowds to the zoo, with art
          enthusiasts and animal lovers alike eager to catch a glimpse of
          Harambe Jr.&apos;s creations. Zoo officials have even started selling
          prints of the artwork, with proceeds going toward wildlife
          conservation efforts.<br />
          <br />
          &quot;This is more than just a gorilla having fun,&quot; said Dr.
          Linda Thompson, a primatologist who has been studying Harambe Jr. for
          years. &quot;It challenges our understanding of animal cognition and
          creativity. Who&apos;s to say this isn&apos;t genuine art?&quot;<br />
          <br />
          However, not everyone is impressed. Local critic Gerard Walters called
          the pieces &quot;childish splatters,&quot; though he conceded that the
          gorilla&apos;s story is &quot;an undeniable cultural
          phenomenon.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          Harambe Jr. has remained modest in the face of fame, enjoying extra
          snacks and an upgraded hammock in his enclosure. Zoo officials are
          considering introducing him to more art supplies, raising the
          tantalizing possibility of a sequel to the Gorilla Gallery.<br />
          <br />
          &quot;Who knows,&quot; said Henderson, now affectionately nicknamed
          &quot;Curator Kyle&quot; by his coworkers. &quot;We might be looking
          at the next Picasso. Or should I say, *Paw-casso*&quot;?<br />
